## The Challenge

The main challenge I saw was to extract the data from the static search pages without sacrificing the cleanliness of the code. 

## Folder Structure

API: Backend, to connect to Google for searching URL, Title and Location Number from Google, .NET 5.0 is used. Docker Support
WEB: Frontend, Angular 13 is used.

## Default Port for Backend

By default, port 8081 is used.

## Docker Support in Backend

Docker Image script file is ready. So backend can create Docker Image and deploy to any Docker Containers.

## About Cross-Origin Requests (CORS)

CORS is enabled in this API backend. All origins are allowed to post data in this server.
